* [Download](https://github.com/Gaareth/DynamicCursor/releases) the exe (or compiled it yourself) 
* Clone this repository

## WARNING
The dynamic cursor works by modifying the registry entry of the default cursor.
By using the exit button in the SystemTray the registry entries will be reverted to: <br>
                
```
{"Arrow", "C:\\Windows\\Cursors\\aero_arrow.cur"},
{"Hand",  "C:\\Windows\\Cursors\\aero_link.cur"}
```

If these are not your default cursors. The cursors may be a bit different.
